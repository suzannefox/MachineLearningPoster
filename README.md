# Machine Learning Poster

This was an exercise completed for the Machine Learning module of my MSc course. The task was to choose two 
different Machine Learning models, hypothesize which would perform better and why, and then test the theory. 
The results were presented as a presentation quality poster suitable for an academic conference.

My colleague and I chose a social dataset from the UCI repository which recorded results for Maths and Protuguese 
in 2 different schools, and we evaluated Naive Bayes and Decision Tree models.
